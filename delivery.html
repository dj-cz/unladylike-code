<h1>Delivery & Returns</h1>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>You can buy the products displayed here in the Unladylike Code shop on RedBubble. Redbubble is a website where independent creators can set up a shop with their desings and Redbubble takes care of the printing and delivery part. After clicking on each product, you will be redirected to the Redbubble shop where you can make the purchase.</p>

<h2>Delivery & Returns</h2>
Since Unladylike Code doesn't directly ship any products, please see RedBubble <a href="https://help.redbubble.com/hc/en-us/articles/203024315-Where-is-my-order" target="_blank">delivery</a> and <a href="https://help.redbubble.com/hc/en-us/articles/201250609-How-can-I-return-my-order" target="_blank">returns</a> rules.
