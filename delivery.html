<h1 class="delivery-title">Delivery & Returns</h1>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>You can buy the products displayed here by visiting the Unladylike Code <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/UnladylikeCode/shop?asc=u" target="_blank">shop on RedBubble</a>. </p>
<p>Redbubble is a website where independent creators can set up a shop with their designs and Redbubble takes care of the printing and delivery part. </p>
<p>After clicking on each product, you will be redirected to the Redbubble shop where you can make the purchase.</p>


<h2>Delivery & Returns</h2>
<p>Since Unladylike Code doesn't directly ship any products and the delivery is done by Redbubble, please see RedBubble <a href="https://help.redbubble.com/hc/en-us/articles/203024315-Where-is-my-order" target="_blank">delivery</a> and <a href="https://help.redbubble.com/hc/en-us/articles/201250609-How-can-I-return-my-order" target="_blank">returns</a> rules.</p> 
<p>Information about delivery for every product is also displayed on the details page of every item.</p>
<p>Redbubble ships products to most countries of the world.</p>
